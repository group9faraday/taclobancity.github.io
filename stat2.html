        <p style="font-size:25px;"> In the province of Leyte, agriculture is the primary industry. The main products include rice, coconut, corn, sugarcane, and fish. An industrial complex that produces sulfuric acid, fertilizer, and refined copper is located in Isabel. Sugar milling and soft drink bottling are two more significant industry facilities in the province. <br><br>

Additionally, the province is home to a geothermal power plant that provides electricity to Southern Leyte, Cebu, and Samar in addition to Leyte Province. Food processing such as fish drying and baking, furniture making, and mat weaving are all examples of cottage enterprises. The government prioritizes the development of the tourism industry.</p>
