            <p><b>When we think of the province Leyte, the first thing that will come in our minds is that it's flooded. A land of typhoons they say. Well, it's somewhat true. Because Leyte is an island that belongs in the Eastern Visayas, a group of archipelago surrounded by the seas and ocean. But there is a looooot more to be discovered about this amazing island. So buckle up and let's discover Leyte! 

            <br><br>
             Located in the Eastern Visayas island group, Leyte is divided into two provinces: Leyte Province which occupies 75% of the island and Southern Leyte which owns the other 25%. Smaller islands can be seen near each province. Bridges connect it across narrow straits to the larger Samar island and to the smaller Biliran island. Tacloban, its capital, found on the east coast, and Ormoc on the west coast, are the two largest cities in Leyte. But worry less, because this island has good transportation so that you can jump from one island to another. 

            <br><br>
             Filled with a diverse array of natural and historical attractions, Leyte is easily one of the best places to visit in the Philippines for outdoor enthusiasts and history buffs wanting to understand and experience the country's charms.</b></p>
