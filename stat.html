        <p class="text"> According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, the Eastern Visayas economy expanded by 6% in 2021, partly as a result of less restrictions on migration, but it is still below its pre-pandemic level (PSA) <br><br>

The achievement is a significant improvement over the Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) growth that was negative 7.4 percent in 2020. The success of all key industries has played a significant role in the rise. <br><br>

The total value of goods and services in the region as measured by the GRDP increased to PHP461 billion in 2021 from PHP438.8 billion in 2020, resulting in PHP26.2 billion economic gains. This level, however, is still PHP8.3 billion lower compared with the 2019 pre-pandemic level, according to PSA Eastern Visayas Regional Director Wilma Perante in a press briefing at the Summit Hotel here. <br><br>

According to the PSA, for the region to achieve the 2019 economic performance once more, there must be an additional 1.8 percent growth. <br><br>

The PSA reported that the services sector, which represents 45.7% of the regional economy, expanded by 6.2 percent in 2017. The subsector of human health and social work activities was responsible for the services sector's outstanding performance. <br><br>

The agriculture, forestry, and fisheries (AFF) sector, on the other hand, managed to develop 0.1 percent slower in 2021 than it did in 2020 (0.9 percent). Only 0.02 percent of the GRDP is made up by the AFF. GRDP calculates the value of the goods and services an area produces. The total of a country's gross domestic product represents all of its regions. </p><br><br>
