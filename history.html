        <p class="text"> Going back in time, in 1521, the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan and his peers visited Leyte. Little did they know, this became the root of the vast history of our country. In 1944, Leyte became the starting point of the liberation of the Philippines during World War II. General Douglas Macarthur left the Philippines who was an American colony during the Japanese invasion in 1942. 2 years later, he returned following his promise, I shall return.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        The Battle of Leyte Gulf, was one of the largest naval battles in history, it took place in Leyte. America won the said battle which resulted to the Philippines being free from the Japanese occupation. In 2013, the infamous typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) struck Leyte and up until now, the island is still on the process of recovering.</p>
